# Form-autofiller
Application that fills in repetitive information fields on online forms/appliactions.

Most of the time there exists some sort of overlap of information fields required by online forms. 

Filling out the same info repetitively is redundant and thus can be automated.

The initial user will be asked to provide some baseline personal information (i.e. Name, Adress, Phone, Email, Ethnicity, ...)

Once that user needs to fill out an online form, he can provide the link of the form and the application will fill it out based on the database info that it has about the user.

If the form is asking for info that is not yet in the personal database of the user, it will ask the user for the missing info, fill out the the remaining fields of the onine form and save the additional info in the database. 

So that the database will be expanding in the initial stages, but over time it will accumulate enough info about the user to fill out most online forms by itself.

The user will be given a choice to either submit certain parts of his info manually into the database for automatic fill-in or enter them manually in the online form. 

Once the application is completed, the user will get a chance to review it. If everything is correct, the user will be able to submit the application.
